# EECS-280---Project-2
This is the Project "Computer Vision" in EECS 280 (Programming and Introductory Data structures) @ UMich

Project "Computer Vision" is the second of five projects that come in EECS 280, focusing on pointers in C++.
The specifications can be found further at [https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/]
- Build an image resizing program using a seam-carving algorithm.
- The learning goals of this project include Testing, Debugging, Pointers, Arrays, Strings, Streams, IO, and Abstract Data Types in C. Youâ€™ll gain practice with C-style pointers, arrays, and structs.

My partner and I scored 97.14% (136/140) on this project, passing public test cases! We missed Matrix_max and compute_vertical_cost_matrix on private tests, which were 2 points each, thus missing a total of 4 points.
